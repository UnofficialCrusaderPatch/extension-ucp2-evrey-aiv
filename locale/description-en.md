# Evrey Castles
The Evrey Castles feature unique designs, which were inspired by the original vanilla AIs with some added perks. The castles were updated by Xander10alpha to be more compatible with plugins that modify the AIs behaviour.
The castles alter the shape and sometimes the economy of the AIs, where they also come with more housing and an updated buildorder as well as an adjusted storage capacity.
The Wolf e.g. uses positive fearfactor to enhance the strength of his troops in exchange for economy and the Abbot build a cross-shaped castle.
This replaces all the AI castles of the Vanilla AIs in their respective order.
